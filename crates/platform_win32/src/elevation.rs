//! Integrity-level checks for UIPI-aware window management.
//!
//! Windows UIPI blocks a process from repositioning a window owned by a process
//! at a *higher mandatory integrity level*: a Medium-integrity (non-elevated)
//! daemon cannot move a High-integrity (elevated/admin) or System window —
//! `SetWindowPos` is silently refused. We detect that up front so the daemon
//! skips such a window instead of reserving a layout column it can never fill.
//!
//! Detection compares the target's integrity level against our own, which
//! subsumes UAC elevation (High vs Medium) and also catches non-elevated
//! higher-integrity owners (e.g. UIAccess, System) that a bare "is the token
//! elevated" check would miss.
