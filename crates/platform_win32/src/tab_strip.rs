//! Tab strip overlay rendered above the focused tabbed column.
//!
//! Mirrors `BorderFrame`'s structure (background thread, layered window,
//! `UpdateLayeredWindow`) but with two key differences:
//! 1. Drops `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` so mouse clicks on the strip are delivered
//!    to this window's WndProc — clicking a tab activates it.
//! 2. Uses GDI text rendering (`CreateFontW` + `TextOutW`) for tab labels.
//!    Uses `ConstantAlpha` blend mode (`AlphaFormat=0`) so per-pixel alpha
//!    isn't required — keeps the rendering path simple while still getting
//!    a translucent strip via `SourceConstantAlpha`.
//!
//! Multi-instance: the daemon owns one `TabStripOverlay` per visible
//! tabbed column (across all monitors / workspaces). Each instance has
//! its own hwnd, its own background message-pump thread, and its own
//! tooltip popup. State is stored in a shared global registry keyed by
//! the strip's hwnd — the WndProc looks up its instance's state by
//! `hwnd`, and the tooltip popup's WndProc looks up its parent strip's
//! state via a `tooltip_hwnd → strip_hwnd` mapping populated at create.
