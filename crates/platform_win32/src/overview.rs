//! Overview overlay: a fullscreen, interactive "map" of the focused
//! monitor's non-empty workspaces (Win+Tab-like), one row per workspace
//! with placeholder cards (title bar + icon body) for each visible window.
//!
//! Mirrors `TabStripOverlay`'s structure (background message-pump thread,
//! mpsc init handshake, daemon-facing handle) but with two differences:
//! 1. The backdrop is the DESKTOP BLURRED through the window: at creation
//!    the overlay enables the undocumented `SetWindowCompositionAttribute`
//!    accent (acrylic, then plain blur). The window stays non-layered and
//!    paints through WM_PAINT: each frame is rendered into a 32bpp DIB —
//!    shapes are SDF-anti-aliased straight into the bits with per-region
//!    alpha (backdrop translucent, cards opaque), GDI draws only text and
//!    icons — and the premultiplied result is `BitBlt`-ed to the window
//!    DC. DWM composites it over the blurred backdrop using the surface
//!    alpha.
//!    When the accent call is unavailable or fails, the overlay falls
//!    back to the previous per-pixel-alpha layered pipeline
//!    (`UpdateLayeredWindow`, alpha-dim instead of blur).
//! 2. It takes the foreground when shown: the overlay handles keyboard
//!    (arrows/Enter/Esc/digits) against its local model copy.
//!
//! The overlay is dumb: the daemon sends a complete [`OverviewModel`]
//! (client-coordinate rects); the overlay only draws and hit-tests it,
//! reporting user intent back through [`OverviewEvent`]s.
